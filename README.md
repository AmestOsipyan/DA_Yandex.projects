# DA_Yandex.projects
This repository is containing the portfolio of data analyst projects that I have done under Data Analysis Course by Yandex Practicum.

This Course prepares me for a career as a data analyst by helping to learn analytics tools (Python, SQL, Jupiter Notebook), how to communicate effectivly and ask questions for making data-driven decisions, how to prepare data for exploration, to clean and organize data, uncover patterns and insights, analyze data to answer questions, statistical analysis, data visualization, presentation skills, etc.

A majority of my projects are done using the Python programming language in Jupyter Notebook. Some of the most used packages are Pandas, Numpy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly.
